    <i data-label="Event Description">
Dimensions is a robotic event which will test the presence of mind, creativity and the logical thinking of the opponent. The game consists of three players in each team and two teams will compete with one another in the event. The arena is of the dimensions 10x10 ft. sq. and each team will have an area 10X5 ft sq. to build their area. The areas will have first region, second region and third region marked. There are two phases in the game, Creation and Destruction.
First four minutes are given for construction, the first phase of the game. Each team is given a layout of how their city should look like. As soon as the timer starts, they have to start building the design with the help of objects scattered randomly in their area with their robot. After four minutes, the robots are halted, and points are given according to the number of objects correctly placed and the level of completion in building.
Destruction is the second phase, which has the duration of three minutes. Here the bots are placed in the opponent’s area, which they will then destroy. When the timer starts, the bots have to displace the objects that consist of the opponent’s city. After three minutes, the robots are again halted. Points are given according the displacement of the objects. The further an object it moved, the more points it has scored.

Buckle up for hands on experience with the bots and prizes worth 9k.

C Tycoon is a unique event that tests the participants not only on their programming skills but also their business and management virtues. Each team ( of maximum 2 members ) will be given a set of problems for which they will have to code a solution in conventional C. In order to code the program the team will have to buy various components of a C program for which they will be provided with virtual money in the start of each round. The team can earn extra money by means of bonus questions and solving in the shortest time. The teams with the best codes will advance to the next round where they can trade the entities not required by them anymore at their own price. The team that saves the maximum money will be declared the winner.

The difficulty level of the questions increases gradually , and the hints from the outputs become tougher to crack.

In order to proceed one must be accurate and fast at solving the problem and simulating the output.    </i>

Round 3: This round involves the teams solving 9 output questions. The output to these questions will need to be put into a position in a Sudoku. The position where the number is to be put is the corresponding question number. The teams then have to solve the Sudoku in a specified time limit.

Bank accounts, ATMs, phones, you name it. Nothing is too much of a challenge for you.

But now you want to leave all that behind. You have seen enough for one life. Only a hacker knows what it is like to constantly be on the run.

But where will you find refuge? How will you find refuge?

By hacking your way out.

There are people after you, your skills and your life. Technology comes at a price, and now you are unjustly indebted to the ruthless Mob. If things could have been better, they didn't; they only got worse. 'Someone' from the Mob leaked your details; and from 'just-some-guy', you have evolved into the Most Wanted criminal of the country.

Redemption and a free life does not come easy. To free yourself, you must hack into the International Security Agency's servers, the world's most secure server, and delete all records of your existence, and emerge as a new identity.

It is time to free yourself, time for that one last hack.

You are John Tracker. You must Get Away, Virtually.

3-D Printing has been dubbed as the technology of the future. In a normal printer, what happens? You get sheets of printed paper with stuff written or drawn on it. Imagine if you could actually print the stuff itself! Yes that`s exactly what a 3-D printer does. It prints out real world 3-D objects like shoes, models, even guitars! Nowadays, it is being used in a variety of fields, like biotechnology, to print artificial hearts and ears, layer by layer, using tissue as a base. Recently the world`s first 3-D printed medicine was manufactured! Mechanical and civil engineers use it to print models and prototypes of their machine and building components with a high degree of accuracy. In this workshop you will learn everything about 3-D printing, right from the design to the manufacturing part. You will explore the applications and the new frontiers that this technology has reached. You will be given industry grade software for free, using which you will be taught to model your 3-D objects. We have 3 international companies, who will be conducting this workshop. The speakers are experts in their fields. We even have more than 2 3-D printers set up during the workshop so you can see the process happening live in front of your eyes! Also we are getting a state of the art 3-D scanner which scans any object and converts it into a CAD model which you can print! At the end of the workshop we will give the participants mementos in the form of their very own 3-D printed objects which they can take back home, along with surprise vouchers!

Numerous IT vendors are promising to offer computation, storage, and application hosting services and to provide coverage in several continents, SLA backed performance and uptime promises for their services. While these "clouds" are the natural evolution of traditional data centers, they are distinguished by exposing resources (computation, data, and applications) as standards-based Web services and following a "utility" pricing model where customers are charged based on their utilization of computational resources, storage, and transfer of data. They offer subscription-based access to infrastructure, platforms, and applications that are popularly referred to as IaaS, PaaS and SaaS .

    <i data-label="Event Description">
The discovery of Google glasses is one such live example why augmented reality is one of the present cutting edge technology. Enhancing one’s current perception of reality, AR technology allows the possibility of superimposing a computer-generated image of the real world, thus providing a composite view for a digitally manipulable, enhanced and interactive view of the user's real world. Along with acting as a tool of amplifying digital information it is a connecting link between reality and virtuality of our environment. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. Augmentation is conventionally in real-time and in semantic context with environmental elements, such as sports scores on TV during a match. With the help of advanced AR technology (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulable.
