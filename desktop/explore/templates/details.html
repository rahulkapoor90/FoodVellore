C Tycoon is a unique event that tests the participants not only on their programming skills but also their business and management virtues. Each team ( of maximum 2 members ) will be given a set of problems for which they will have to code a solution in conventional C. In order to code the program the team will have to buy various components of a C program for which they will be provided with virtual money in the start of each round. The team can earn extra money by means of bonus questions and solving in the shortest time. The teams with the best codes will advance to the next round where they can trade the entities not required by them anymore at their own price. The team that saves the maximum money will be declared the winner.

The properties to be bought here are library functions,data types, arrays,input output console,templates,inheritance ,overloaded functions etc .
Now using only the bought properties one can program the code given with certain restrictions like :JAIL will restrict the number of lines in the program.CHANCE gives you the option of changing the program you have received.

Round 2:In the second round participants will be given a code with errors which they will have to debug and get the output of the program. The first 5teams to finish this correctly within the specified time limit will qualify for the next round.
Round 3: This round involves the teams solving 9 output questions. The output to these questions will need to be put into a position in a Sudoku. The position where the number is to be put is the corresponding question number. The teams then have to solve the Sudoku in a specified time limit. The first three teams to complete this will be the winners.

You might have watched Hollywood movie Resident Evil, thoughts might came to your mind that how one can make a beehive structure under a city and that even 1000Õs of meters under the ground. These structures are not possible today but can be made in future. Today we have drainage system which is a very big network that keeps a city clean and hassle free. It take a huge effort to dig 100 meters of ground and lay down pipes and sewers with maintaining the flow of drain. In order to make this effort understandable to all, You can design your own city and make itÕs drainage without hassle.

BitzerÕ turns on its head in that where most other events seek to simplify a complex problem, this requires you to enthrall the judges and the audience with your ability to convolute the most simplest of actions with an infinite array of steps!!

Put your basic engineering skills to test with so many twists and turns.And then all you need is planning, innovation, efficiency in steps and use of material to stay in the reckoning.

Introduction Interlocking blocks are like 2 adjoining pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Each block has a projection at one end and a depression at the other. The projection of one block fits in to the depression of the next so that they always align perfectly. The blocks have vertical holes in them which have a double purpose. . Interlocking blocks may not solve all construction problems, but they do resolve many issues associated with traditional materials. Participants have to design the bricks using the plaster of Paris sheet that will be given to them at event.

    <i data-label="Event Description">
The discovery of Google glasses is one such live example why augmented reality is one of the present cutting edge technology. Enhancing one’s current perception of reality, AR technology allows the possibility of superimposing a computer-generated image of the real world, thus providing a composite view for a digitally manipulable, enhanced and interactive view of the user's real world. Along with acting as a tool of amplifying digital information it is a connecting link between reality and virtuality of our environment. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. Augmentation is conventionally in real-time and in semantic context with environmental elements, such as sports scores on TV during a match. With the help of advanced AR technology (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulable.

Our brain is motivated to think and invent through the course of practical experimentation. Keeping this in mind, we have designed the workshop to amalgamate basic theory sessions and understand the advanced applications through hands on practical sessions.
